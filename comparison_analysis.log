CAREFLOW SYSTEM COMPARISON: Yesterday (Jan 29, 18:00 CET) vs Now
================================================================================
Generated: January 30, 2026

SITUATION YESTERDAY (Jan 29, 2026 ~18:00 CET):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All 3 gateways (CFS1, CFS2, CFS3) were connected and showing data
- Auto-discovery was ON
- Many unwanted beacons were being detected (not the installed ones)
- You turned auto-discovery OFF to stop the flood of unknown beacons

SITUATION NOW:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- CFS1: Connected and actively publishing beacon data
- CFS2: Shows as "Installed" (connected to EMQX but NOT publishing beacon data)
- CFS3: Shows as "Installed" (connected to EMQX but NOT publishing beacon data)
- Auto-discovery: OFF (intentionally disabled)

================================================================================
MQTT DATA FLOW ANALYSIS
================================================================================

WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH EACH GATEWAY:

CFS1 (00:E0:4C:00:6B:F1):
  Status: ACTIVE - Publishing data every ~2 seconds
  Topic: /cfs1/00e04c006bf1/publish
  Beacons detected: 21baa114b3ed, c02ced793725, 6fd7d54bdbbb, etc.
  
CFS2 (00:E0:4C:00:6B:E5):
  Status: SILENT - Connected to EMQX but NOT publishing any beacon data
  Expected topic: /cfs2/00e04c006be5/publish
  Last seen publishing: Unknown (no recent data in logs)
  
CFS3 (00:E0:4C:00:6C:A5):
  Status: SILENT - Connected to EMQX but NOT publishing any beacon data  
  Expected topic: /cfs3/00e04c006ca5/publish
  Last seen publishing: Unknown (no recent data in logs)

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The issue is NOT with the Careflow application - it's with the gateways themselves:

1. CFS2 and CFS3 are connected to the MQTT broker (EMQX shows them connected)
2. BUT they are NOT publishing any beacon scan data
3. This could be caused by:
   a) Gateway configuration issue (scan interval, BLE settings)
   b) Gateway firmware/software problem
   c) Gateway power cycle needed
   d) Network connectivity issue between gateway and broker
   e) The gateways may be in a "listening" mode but not "scanning" mode

REGISTERED BEACONS (what you WANT to track):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| MAC Address         | Name               | Type    | Active |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------| -------|
| C9:02:4A:14:5E:61   | Beatmungsgerät 123 | Asset   | Yes    |
| C1:1B:8B:E4:9A:E1   | Wristband 2        | Staff   | Yes    |
| FB:80:BF:BA:0E:9F   | EKG Monitor Wagen  | Vehicle | Yes    |
| E4:66:D8:C7:01:18   | Wristband 1        | Staff   | No     |
| C9:29:EF:22:38:EA   | Asset Tag 1        | Device  | No     |
| C2:AD:1E:A5:CB:33   | Asset Tag 2        | Device  | No     |

BEACONS BEING DETECTED (by CFS1):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| MAC (formatted)     | Notes                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 21:BA:A1:14:B3:ED   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |
| C0:2C:ED:79:37:25   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |
| 6F:D7:D5:4B:DB:BB   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |
| 31:9A:B8:1B:0E:A9   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |

| 25:BE:2D:5C:AA:93   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |
| 3D:06:B0:24:4A:9F   | Unknown - NOT in registered list         |

MATCH STATUS: ZERO MATCHES between detected and registered beacons!

================================================================================
WHY NO DATA IS BEING STORED
================================================================================

The Careflow application is working correctly, but:

1. Auto-discovery = OFF (you disabled it)
2. Only signals from REGISTERED beacons are stored
3. None of the beacons being detected by CFS1 are registered
4. Therefore: 0 signals stored

This is EXPECTED BEHAVIOR given your configuration.

================================================================================
ACTION ITEMS TO FIX
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE - Check CFS2 and CFS3 gateways:
1. Verify they are powered on and have network connectivity
2. Check their configuration in the Moko gateway app/web interface
3. Ensure they are set to actively scan and publish beacon data
4. Try power cycling both gateways

TO GET DATA FLOWING:
Option A: Place your REGISTERED beacons (Wristband 2, Beatmungsgerät, EKG Monitor) 
          near CFS1 gateway - they should then be detected and stored

Option B: Register one of the detected beacons for testing:
          e.g., Add beacon with MAC 21:BA:A1:14:B3:ED as "Test Beacon"

Option C: Temporarily enable auto-discovery to see all beacons, then 
          disable again after registering the ones you want
